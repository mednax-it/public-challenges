Automate user tests on the Calculator app with Selenium Webdriver
---

We would setup a simple automated user testing routine for [this Calculator app](https://ahfarmer.github.io/calculator/). Please build us a green-field Javascript implementation using the [Selenium Web-Driver ](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html).

You should create a series of tests that perform the following user actions:

  - Browse to the Calculator App  
  - Add 1 and 3 
  - Subtract 4 from 9
  - Multiply 3 by 1
  - Divide 10 by 2

When you are done, share the code with [@max-at-mednax](https://github.com/max-at-mednax) via github.
