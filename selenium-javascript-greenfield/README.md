Selenium Implementation in Javascript
---

We would like to do some automated user testing on [this Calculator app](https://ahfarmer.github.io/calculator/).

Please build us a green-field Javascript project implementing the [Selenium Web-Driver in Javascript](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html).

You should create one or more scripts that perform the following things:

  - Browse to the Calculator App  
  - Create a test for doing addition - Add 1 and 3 
  - Create a test for doing subtraction - Minus 4 from 9
  - Create a test for doing multiplication - Multiply 3 by 1
  -  Create a test for doing division - Divide 10 by 2

When you are done, share the code with `@max_at_mednax` via github.
