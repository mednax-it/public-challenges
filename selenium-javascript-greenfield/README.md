Selenium Implementation in Javascript
---

We would like to do some automated user testing on [this Calculator app](https://ahfarmer.github.io/calculator/).

Please build us a green-field Javascript project implementing the [Selenium Web-Driver in Javascript](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/javascript/index.html).

You should create a series of test scripts that perform the following user actions:

  - Browse to the Calculator App  
  - Add 1 and 3 
  - Subtract 4 from 9
  - Multiply 3 by 1
  - Divide 10 by 2

When you are done, share the code with `@max_at_mednax` via github.
